Monit also verifies that Nginx is listening on port 80. If not found, Monit will restart Nginx after 3 CPU cycles.

```
check process nginx with pidfile /run/nginx.pid
  start program = "/usr/sbin/service nginx start"
  stop program = "/usr/sbin/service nginx stop"
  if failed host 127.0.0.1 port 80 protocol http for 3 cycles then restart
```

*Check Monit Configuration Syntax:*
